# Creative Studio Infrastructure

This repository contains the Terraform configuration for deploying the Creative Studio application platform (frontend and backend) to Google Cloud.

## üöÄ Overview

This infrastructure is managed using a modular, environment-based approach with Terraform. The key principles are:
* **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** All the logic for creating a service is defined once in a reusable **module**.
* **Strong Isolation:** Each environment (`dev`, `prod`, etc.) is managed in its own directory, with its own state file, to prevent accidental changes to production.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

The project is organized into `modules` and `environments`.

```
infrastructure/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/                # Reusable "Blueprints"
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cloud-run-service/  # Defines how to build ONE service
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ platform/           # Defines the ENTIRE application platform
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ environments/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/                # Configuration for the 'dev' environment
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf         # Calls the platform module with dev values
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend.tf      # Defines where to store the dev state file
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev.tfvars      # Contains all variables for dev
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prod/               # Configuration for the 'prod' environment
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
* **`/modules`**: Contains reusable building blocks. The `platform` module is the main entry point, which in turn uses the `cloud-run-service` module.
* **`/environments`**: Contains a directory for each distinct deployment environment. These directories call the `platform` module with the correct set of variables.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Setup Steps

Before you can use Terraform, you must perform these one-time manual steps.

> ### 1. Install Prerequisite Software
> You must install the following command-line tools on your local machine:
> * **Terraform CLI:** [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
> * **Google Cloud SDK:** [Install gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

> ### 2. Authenticate with Google Cloud
> You need to authenticate your local machine with Google Cloud. This command will open a browser for you to log in.
> ```bash
> gcloud auth application-default login
> ```

> ### 3. Create a GCS Bucket for Terraform State
> Terraform needs a GCS bucket to store its state file for each environment. This must be done manually because the backend configuration is read before Terraform can create any resources.
>
> **Run this command for each environment (dev, prod, etc.), making sure to use a globally unique bucket name:**
> ```bash
> # Example for the 'dev' environment
> gsutil mb -p [YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID] gs://cstudio-dev-tfstate
> ```

> ### 4. Connect GitHub to Cloud Build
> You must authorize Google Cloud Build to access your GitHub repository.
> 1.  Go to the Google Cloud Console: **Cloud Build > Settings**.
> 2.  Click **Connect repository**.
> 3.  Choose **GitHub (Cloud Build GitHub App)** as the source.
> 4.  Follow the prompts to authenticate and install the GitHub App on your account.
> 5.  **Crucially, grant the app access to your `MauroCominotti/maurocominotti-vertex-ai-creative-studio` repository.**
> 6.  Note the **Connection Name** (e.g., `gh-mauro-con`) as you will need it for your `.tfvars` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Managing Environments

All commands should be run from within a specific environment's directory.

### Deploying an Existing Environment (e.g., `dev`)

1.  **Navigate to the `dev` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd environments/dev
    ```
2.  **Initialize Terraform:**
    This downloads the necessary providers and configures the remote state backend.
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
3.  **Plan the changes:**
    Always review the plan carefully before applying.
    ```bash
    terraform plan -var-file="dev.tfvars"
    ```
4.  **Apply the changes:**
    This will build and deploy the infrastructure.
    ```bash
    terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"
    ```

### Creating a New Environment (e.g., `staging`)

1.  **Perform Manual Setup:** Create a new GCS bucket for the staging state (see Manual Step #3 above).
2.  **Create the Directory:** Copy the `dev` directory: `cp -r environments/dev environments/staging`
3.  **Configure `backend.tf`:** Edit `environments/staging/backend.tf` to point to your new staging GCS bucket.
4.  **Configure `staging.tfvars`:** Rename `dev.tfvars` to `staging.tfvars` and update the values inside (project ID, service names, etc.) for your new environment.
5.  **Deploy:** Navigate to the new directory and run the standard `init` and `apply` commands.
    ```bash
    cd environments/staging
    terraform init
    terraform apply -var-file="staging.tfvars"
    ```
